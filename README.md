# Prosper's landing page

## Sentence description
I'm a huge Wizkid fan so I decided to make him a landing page for this project. It helped drive me since I want it to be professional enough for him. I found animations and media queries quite difficult but playing around with it really helped. I also realized how much work frameworks do and I respect them more now.
